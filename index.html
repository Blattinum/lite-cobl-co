            <p>Ronald Wilson Reagan (February 6, 1911 â€“ June 5, 2004) was an American politician who
                served as the 40th president of the United States from 1981 to 1989 and became a highly influential
                voice of modern conservatism. Prior to his presidency, he was a Hollywood actor and union leader before
                serving as the 33rd governor of California from 1967 to 1975.
            </p>
            <p>In 1980, Reagan won the Republican presidential nomination and defeated the incumbent president, Jimmy
                Carter. At 69 years of age at the time of his first inauguration, Reagan was the oldest first-term U.S.
                president, a distinction he held until 2017, when Donald Trump was inaugurated at age 70. Reagan was
                re-elected in 1984, winning 58.8% of the national popular vote and losing only Washington, D.C. and his
                opponent Walter Mondale's home state of Minnesota, in one of the most lopsided victories in modern
                American history.</p>
